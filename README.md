🧠 How It Works

The app uses a reactive state (State) to manage tasks. Each task is a dictionary with text and done fields. Users can:
- Add a task via the input field.
- Toggle completion status by clicking the checkbox.
- Delete a task by clicking the ❌ icon.
The UI is built using Reflex components like vstack, hstack, input, button, and foreach.




🌐 Deployment

You can deploy the app using Reflex's built-in deployment tools or host it on platforms like Vercel or Netlify after exporting it as a static site:
reflex export
